<p><strong>Price Range</strong></p>
<p>At QikGrub we don&rsquo;t decide on the pricing. We are only a technology platform to connect the food vendors to the customers. All pricing is decided by the respective registered vendors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price is listed against each food item and is provided to the users (customers) beforehand by the vendor. Typically the range of transactions on our website varies from INR 15 to 2500. This can vary based on what our registered vendors would like to add to their menu list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Schedule of payment</strong></p>
<p>Some of our services can be utilised for fixed durations as long as the vendor decides to keep the service on. In such cases, it is clearly mentioned within the description of these services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Price Matching</strong></p>
<p>QikGrub does not control the price of any listed food item. All the pricing is controlled directly by the registered vendors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sale Adjustment</strong></p>
<p>Not Applicable</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pricing Errors</strong></p>
<p>We work hard to ensure the accuracy of pricing. Despite our efforts, pricing errors may still occur. In any such discrepancies the user should directly contact the vendor as QikGrub does not have any control on the pricing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shopping Cart</strong></p>
<p>Items in your cart reflect the current price displayed on the item's product details page. Please note: This price may differ from the price displayed when the item was first placed in your Shopping Cart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our food items are offered for sale by our registered vendors for your personal enjoyment and not for resale. Therefore, we reserve the right to refuse to sell to any person whom we believe may be purchasing for resale.</p>
