	  <p> <strong>SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
	  <br>
	  <p> When you purchase something through our app, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address. </p>
	  
	  <p> When you browse our app, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system. </p>
	  
	  <p> Email marketing (if applicable): With your permission, we may send you emails about our new features, new products and other updates.</p>
	  <br>


	  <p> <strong>SECTION 2 - CONSENT</strong></p>
	  <br>
	  <p> How do you get my consent? </p>
	  
	  <p> When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.</p>
	  
	  <p> If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.</p>
	  
	 <p> How do I withdraw my consent?</p>
 
 <p> If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at <a href="mailto:help@qikgrub.com">help@qikgrub.com</a> </p>

      <br>

	  <p> <strong>SECTION 4 - PAYMENT</strong></p>
	  <br>
	  <p> We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not store your card data on their servers. The data is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when processing payment. Your purchase transaction data is only used as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is not saved.</p>
	  
	  <p> Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.</p>
	  <p> PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our app and its service providers.</p>

	  <p> In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.</p>
	  
	  <p> However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.</p>
	  <p> For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>
	  <p> In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located at different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>
	  <p> Once you leave our app’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service. </p>

If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here that it has been updated, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or disclose it.</p>
